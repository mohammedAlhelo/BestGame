the game contains a board which is made from different elemnts numbered from 1 to 25, you will role a dice which will give you a random number between 1 and 6 then it will switch players. the player one and two will be displayed above the board to know which turn it is. the number from the dice will move the player along the board, there are different adders such as snake and ladder which will help increase or decrease the steps taken by the player. if it happens and one player over lapped with other player in the same block the first player will return to the first block. the player is location will be visible by the change of colours in the blocks for example red for player and blue for player two. at the last column the player will need to get the exact number or lower to finish the game for ex: if there is three steps left and he got four it will pass to the other player turn, while if he got a lower number he will move along. when a player reaches the end an alert will pop declaring the winner
